    "Q.2 Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples ?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS. In Python, **mutable data types** are those whose values can be **changed or modified** after they are created, while **immutable data types** cannot be altered once created. Mutable types allow in-place updates, additions, or deletions, making them suitable for situations where the data needs to be frequently modified. Examples of mutable types include **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **sets**. For instance, in a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`, you can change an element like `numbers[0] = 100`, and the list updates in place. In contrast, immutable types provide **data stability and integrity**, ensuring that the value remains constant throughout the program. Examples of immutable types include **strings**, **tuples**, and **numbers (int, float, etc.)**. For example, if you have a string `text = \"hello\"`, attempting to modify a character like `text[0] = \"H\"` would result in an error; instead, operations like concatenation create a **new string**. In short, mutable types are flexible and changeable, while immutable types are fixed and safer for maintaining consistent data.\n",

    "Q.3 What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS. In Python, **lists** and **tuples** are both sequence data types that can store collections of items, but they differ primarily in **mutability, performance, and usage**. Lists are **mutable**, meaning their elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation, making them ideal for dynamic collections where changes are frequent. They are defined using square brackets, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, and provide a wide range of methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`. Tuples, on the other hand, are **immutable**, meaning once created, their elements cannot be altered. They are defined using parentheses, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, and have fewer built-in methods, mainly `count()` and `index()`. Because of their immutability, tuples are **faster and more memory-efficient** than lists and can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, whereas lists cannot. In practice, lists are preferred for collections that require frequent modification, while tuples are suitable for **fixed collections of data** where integrity and performance are important.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS. In Python, tuples help ensure data integrity because they are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability guarantees that the data stored in a tuple will remain consistent throughout the program, protecting it from accidental modifications. For example, if you store fixed information such as geographic coordinates, dates, or configuration settings in a tuple, you can be confident that these values will not be altered during execution. Additionally, because tuples are hashable (when containing only immutable elements), they can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets, further supporting reliable and consistent data management. In short, tuples provide a secure way of storing constant data, ensuring stability and integrity in applications where preserving the original information is crucial."

    "Q.8 What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS. A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key–value pairs and uses a hashing function to map each key to a specific memory location, called a bucket or slot. The hash function converts the key into a hash value (an integer), which determines where the associated value is stored. This makes operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup very fast, usually in constant time O(1). In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you create a dictionary and store a key–value pair, Python hashes the key, finds the appropriate slot in the hash table, and places the value there. Later, when you access the dictionary using that key, Python hashes the key again and retrieves the value directly from the mapped slot, without scanning all entries. This is why dictionaries in Python allow for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions, and why keys must be immutable (so their hash values remain consistent)."

    "ANS. es, lists in Python can contain different data types because Python is a dynamically typed language. A single list can store integers, floats, strings, booleans, objects, or even other lists as its elements. For example, a list like [10, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3]] is perfectly valid in Python. This flexibility makes lists very powerful for handling mixed collections of data without needing to define a fixed type for the elements. However, while lists can hold heterogeneous data, this can sometimes reduce efficiency compared to lists with uniform data types, since operations may need to account for the differences in types."

    "ANS. trings in Python are immutable because once a string object is created, its contents cannot be changed. This design choice ensures data consistency, security, and efficiency. Since strings are used frequently (for example, as keys in dictionaries or for text processing), immutability guarantees that their hash values remain constant, making them reliable for use in hash-based data structures. It also allows Python to optimize memory usage through techniques like string interning, where identical strings are stored only once in memory and shared across references. By preventing in-place modifications, immutability also avoids accidental data changes, making programs safer and easier to debug. Instead of altering the original string, any operation that seems to \"modify\" a string actually creates a new string object, leaving the original unchanged."

    "ANS. Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks because they store data as key–value pairs rather than a simple sequence of elements. This structure allows for fast and direct access to values using keys, typically in constant time O(1), whereas searching for an item in a list may require scanning each element sequentially, taking linear time O(n). Dictionaries are particularly useful when you need to associate related pieces of information, such as storing a person’s age, address, and phone number under their name as the key. They also prevent the need for maintaining indexes manually, allow for efficient updates and deletions, and can use immutable objects as keys to ensure reliable access. Overall, dictionaries provide superior performance and clarity for tasks that involve mapping, lookup, or organizing data by unique identifiers, making them more suitable than lists for these purposes."

    "ANS. In Python, sets automatically handle duplicate values by removing them, ensuring that each element in the set is unique. When you try to add a value that already exists in a set, Python ignores it instead of creating a duplicate entry. This behavior is due to the way sets are implemented using hash tables, where each element is stored based on its hash value. If a new element has the same hash as an existing one, the set recognizes it as already present and does not add it again. This makes sets particularly useful for tasks that require uniqueness, such as removing duplicates from a collection, tracking distinct items, or performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference."

Lists are preferred over dictionaries in situations where the order of elements matters, when you need to store a simple collection of items without requiring unique keys, or when the data will be accessed primarily by **position or index** rather than by a specific key. For example, if you are maintaining a sequence of daily temperatures, a list allows you to easily iterate through the values in order or access the nth day’s temperature using its index. Lists are also suitable when the dataset is small or when you need to perform operations like sorting, slicing, or appending elements frequently.

    "Q.19 Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS. Dictionaries in Python are considered **unordered** (at least in versions before Python 3.7) because the elements are stored based on **hash values of their keys**, rather than in the sequence they were added. This means there is no inherent order to the key–value pairs, and you cannot rely on the items appearing in a specific sequence when iterating over the dictionary. As a result, data retrieval is done **directly via keys** rather than by position, which is why dictionaries provide **fast lookups (O(1) time complexity)** but do not support index-based access like lists. In modern Python versions (3.7 and later), dictionaries **preserve insertion order**, but the underlying mechanism is still hash-based, so the primary way to retrieve values efficiently remains key-based rather than positional. This unordered nature emphasizes that dictionaries are optimized for **associative mapping** rather than sequential access.\n"
